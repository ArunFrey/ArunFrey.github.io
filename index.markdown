I am a PhD Sociology candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/arun-frey.html), and a member of the [T.E. Lawrence Program on the Study of Conflict](https://www.teloxford.org/members). Currently, I am based at [Harvard University](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/arun-frey) as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Sociology. My research agenda spans the areas of migration, conflict, collective action, and inequality, and is supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council and the German Academic Scholarship Foundation.

The central motivation for my doctoral research is to examine the conditions under which immigration mobilizes opposition---particularly outside the political arena---and what such opposition entails for marginalized communities. To study these phenomena, I rely on a combination of administrative, survey, and web-scraped data sources, and take an active interest in the field of computational social science. A chapter of my PhD thesis has recently been published at the [European Sociological Review](https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaa007/5814862). 

In other on-going projects I study the online consequences of collective action (with Christopher Barrie), educational inequality in the face of a global pandemic (with Per Engzell and Mark Verhagen), and the formation of political attitudes following mass shootings (with David Kirk). Together, this work is motivated by a larger desire to study the social processes that beget and reproduce inequalities between social groups.
