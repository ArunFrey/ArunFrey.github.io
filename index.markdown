I am a PhD Sociology candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/arun-frey.html). Currently, I am based at [Harvard University](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/arun-frey) as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Sociology. My research uses computational methods to contribute to the areas of violence, migration, and inequality. 

The central motivation for my doctoral research is to examine the conditions under which immigration mobilizes opposition---particularly outside the political arena---and what such opposition entails for marginalized communities. To study these phenomena, I rely on a combination of administrative, survey, and web-scraped data sources, and take an active interest in the field of computational social science. A chapter of my PhD thesis has recently been published at the [European Sociological Review](https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaa007/5814862). 

This work is motivated by a larger desire to study the social processes that beget and reproduce inequalities between social groups. To this end, I examine how COVID-19 impedes student progress and exacerbates educational inequality (with Per Engzell and Mark Verhagen).
