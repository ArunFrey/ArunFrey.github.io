I teach applied statistics to undergraduate students at the [_Oxford Q-Step Centre_](https://www.oqc.ox.ac.uk/graduate-teaching-assistant/arun-frey.html), and am a TA for Prof. David Kirk's graduate course on _Applied Statistics for Social Scientists_. I occassionally give tutorial on _Political Sociology_ and _Social Movements_ and seminars on how to code in `R`.
