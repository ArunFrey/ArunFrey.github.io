I teach applied statistics to undergraduate students at the [Oxford Q-Step Centre](https://www.oqc.ox.ac.uk/graduate-teaching-assistant/arun-frey.html), and am a TA for Prof. David Kirk's graduate course on Applied Statistics for Social Scientists. I occassionally give tutorials and seminars on _Political Sociology_ and _Social Movements and Collective Action_.
