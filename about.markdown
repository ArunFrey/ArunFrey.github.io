I am a PhD Sociology candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/arun-frey.html), and am currently based at [Harvard Univeristy](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/arun-frey) as a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Sociology. 

My research agenda spans the areas of migration, conflict, collective action, and inequality. The central motivation for my doctoral research is to examine the conditions under which immigration mobilizes opposition--particularly outside the political arena--and what such opposition entails for marginalized communities. 

To study these phenomena, I rely on a combination of administrative, survey, and web-scraped data sources, and take an active interest in the field of computational social science. A chapter of my PhD thesis has recently been published at the [European Sociological Review](https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaa007/5814862).
